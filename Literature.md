Li, Susan. "How Did We Build Book Recommender Systems in An Hour Part 2 — k Nearest Neighbors and Matrix Factorization." Towards Data Science, Medium, Sept. 2017, https://towardsdatascience.com/how-did-we-build-book-recommender-systems-in-an-hour-part-2-k-nearest-neighbors-and-matrix-c04b3c2ef55c.
>Li explains how she used a kNN and a Matrix Factorization model to find similarities among book readers in order to predict what a reader would review a new book. This is obviously very similar in structure to our project, as we also were looking at user, or restaurant attendee, in order to predict what he or she would rate a restaurant.
